    //! an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are

    //! implement for example menus, popovers, tooltips and other similar user
    //! interface concepts.
    //! 
    //! A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for
    //! details.
    //! 
    //! When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at
    //! the same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done
    //! event for details.
    //! 
    //! Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and
    //! unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
    //! surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
    //! request.
    //! 
    //! The parent surface must have either the xdg_toplevel or xdg_popup surface
    //! role.
    //! 
    //! A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
    //! xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.
    //! 
    //! The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
    //! description) before the xdg_popup itself.
    //! 
    //! The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
    //! where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the
    //! local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
    //! xdg_surface.get_popup. An xdg_popup must intersect with or be at least
    //! partially adjacent to its parent surface.
    //! 
    //! The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
    //! for the xdg_popup state to take effect.
